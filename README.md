# Data-Science-Project-Olist-Marketing-and-E-commerce
Using the Brazilian Olist Marketing and E-commerce dataset, sales trends were analysed and revenue was evaluated for 2016, 2017 and 2018. Data was also explored to suggest marketing strategies for subsequent increase in future sales and revenue. 

## Data Visualisation and Analysis
- Box plots were used to analyse payment values to discern the average order amount. The box plots represented the median, quartiles (25th and 75th) and the outliers. An instance is shown below:

- Bar graphs were used to visualise monthly revenue. Months with the highest and lowest sales were and the categories with the maximum sales plus the corresponding revenue generated by that category in that month was also figured out. An instance is shown below:

- Weekly sales analysis surprisingly showed lesser sales during the weekend.
- Hourly sales analysis shows high sales from 9 am to 11 pm. Working hours in Brazil are roughly between 8 am to 6 pm.
- Positive correlation was observed between the number of photos available for a product and its sales especially in categories like female fashion.


## Data Preparation
- Data is clenaed by removing rows with null values.
- Grouped rows and columns from different data frames having a common variable.

## Machine Learning
- The aim is to predict future revenue by analysing past revenue. 
- For monthly revenue prediction, we have used the model called _Prophet_ designed by Facebook. This model can capture seasonal variations very well (good for sales data as they are expected to have sales variations), the user does not need to specify any parameters (the model itself decides its parameter).
- The other alternative we looked into was _auto ARIMA_ which does not work well with seasonal variations. If we used ARIMA, we would have to specify the parameters correctly.
- Time series data for 2017 was analysed. X-axis showed the months in the year while the Y-axis denoted the respective revenue for that month. An instance is shown below:
